Last User messages: fica mais facil pra voce realizar esse dashboard em outra linguam? como REACT?

Summary of the conversation: Here is the summary of our conversation until now:
In the conversation until now, the user provided a CSV file named `acidentes_mg_dashboard_master.csv` containing accident data. The assistant loaded this data, normalized column names, and provided a summary of the dataset, including column names and the number of rows (18858).

The user then requested a structured approach to analyze the data, focusing on:
1.  Calculating indicators from the CSV.
2.  Designing a dashboard layout.
3.  Running advanced analyses (models, logic, metrics).
4.  Providing ready-made texts for "Analyst Insights," "Action Plan," and "Patterns of Serious Accidents."

The assistant responded by outlining a comprehensive plan in 6 parts, assuming a "power user/analyst" level of technical language. This plan detailed:
1.  **Data Structure and Derived Indicators**: Basic normalization of columns (e.g., `data_inversa_x` for date, `municipio_x` for municipality), and calculated measures like Mortality Rate, Injured Rate per Accident, Severity Index, Average Accidents per Day, Average per Municipality, Accidents per Km of Highway, and Percentage Distribution by Cause and Accident Type. It also suggested creating a fact table for "Accident" and a dimension for "Involved/Vehicles" for BI tools.
2.  **Main Dashboard Layout**: Proposed an 8-card horizontal layout for key KPIs (Total Accidents, Total Deaths, Total Injured, Mortality Rate, Average Severity Index, Daily Average Accidents, Top Municipality, Top Highway). It also suggested various interactive charts for the middle section (time series for accidents and deaths, heatmap for time x day of week, distributions by cause, type, weather, and day phase, rankings for municipalities and BRs, and a scatter plot for vehicles vs. severity). Interactive filters for various dimensions were also recommended.
3.  **Critical Areas Module**: Suggested a separate tab or sub-panel focusing on risk, including Top 10 municipalities by severity index, Top 10 highways by mortality rate, critical periods (month + time slot), causes associated with fatal accidents, and recurring patterns (e.g., night + single lane + rain). It also outlined how to display rankings, patterns, automatic alerts, and preventive recommendations.
4.  **Advanced Analytical Models**: Described the logic for implementing models:
    *   **Impact of Factors on Severity (Regression)**: Using logistic regression for probability of death and Poisson/Negative Binomial for `gravidade_score`, explaining how to interpret odds ratios.
    *   **Causality**: Applicable with known interventions, suggesting Difference-in-Differences or Causal Impact, and approximating impact of night, rain, or single vs. double lanes.
    *   **Mathematical Relationships**: Correlations between vehicles and deaths, time and severity, and specific causes and fatality.
    *   **Forecasts (Time Series)**: Using ARIMA/Prophet/Exponential Smoothing for monthly accidents, deaths, and severity index, with a 12-month horizon.
    *   **Automatic Recommendations**: Based on model results (e.g., intensify night enforcement if `OR_noite` is high).
5.  **Additional Tabs**: Provided ready-made text structures for "Analyst Insights" (general patterns, temporal trends, critical conditions, vulnerable regions, typical profile of serious accidents), "Action Plan" (table with proposed actions, target factors, potential impact, estimated mortality reduction, timeline, and responsible parties), and "Patterns of Serious Accidents" (statistical summary of predominant time, weather, road type, causes, and regional profile for severe accidents).
6.  **Visual and UX Guidelines**: Recommended a color palette, typography, organization, and interactivity features for the dashboard.

Finally, the assistant offered to provide a Python notebook skeleton or adapt the solution for Power BI DAX. The user chose to proceed with a Python notebook skeleton using `pandas`, `plotly`, `statsmodels`, and `prophet`.

The assistant then provided a comprehensive Python notebook skeleton, adapted to the user's CSV file. This skeleton included:
-   **Data Loading and Preparation**: Reading the CSV, converting date columns, creating time-based features, handling numerical columns, calculating `gravidade_score`, and flagging fatal accidents.
-   **Global Indicators**: Calculating and displaying key KPIs like total accidents, deaths, injured, mortality rate, severity index, and top municipality/BR.
-   **Basic Time Series**: Generating line plots for monthly accidents and deaths.
-   **Heatmap**: Creating a heatmap for accidents by hour and day of the week.
-   **Distributions and Rankings**: Generating bar charts for accident causes, types, weather conditions, day phases, and rankings of municipalities and BRs.
-   **Critical Areas**: Identifying and displaying top municipalities by severity, top BRs by mortality rate, critical periods, and causes of fatal accidents.
-   **Correlation**: A scatter plot showing the correlation between the number of vehicles and accident severity.
-   **Regression Models**: A section for Logistic Regression to predict the probability of death based on various factors, and an optional Poisson/Negative Binomial model for severity score.
-   **Prophet Forecasts**: Functions and calls to forecast monthly accidents, deaths, and severity index for the next 12 months.
-   **Next Steps**: Suggestions for integrating into a dashboard, creating alerts, and generating automatic reports.

The user then requested to adapt the solution to run in Streamlit as a web dashboard. The user encountered a `FileNotFoundError` when running the Streamlit app. The assistant identified the error as the CSV file not being found and provided three solutions: using an absolute path, a path relative to `app.py` (recommended), or a dynamic file uploader.

The user then expressed dissatisfaction with the visual presentation of the dashboard, stating it needed to be "much more presentable" and offered to send a Figma model for replication. The assistant confirmed its ability to replicate the Figma design using custom CSS, Plotly theming, Streamlit containers/columns, and potentially external libraries, asking for the Figma link or an image.

The user provided an image (`imagem_2026-02-20_145644881.png`) and a Figma link (`https://www.figma.com/design/VDOJyyXtTaVAuEJMOCPbA9/Dashboard--Community-?node-id=0-1&t=evK22JKMzQMNLKY9-1`). The assistant then provided a Streamlit app skeleton (`app.py`) adapted to the Figma layout, incorporating custom CSS for a clean, modern look, KPI cards, and basic chart placeholders. It used a color palette similar to the Figma design (purple/light blue + gray).

The user again expressed dissatisfaction, stating "nao curti o resultado, podemos tentar outro modelo?". The assistant acknowledged this and proposed a "Version 2.0 (Estilo Premium SaaS)" focusing on a grid layout, stylized tables, and minimalist graphics, based on the user's Figma model. It provided a new Streamlit code snippet with updated CSS for a more modern, clean aesthetic, including KPI cards and chart containers.

The user then uploaded another image (`imagem_2026-02-20_150543256.png`) and provided a new Figma link (`https://www.figma.com/design/6YW9fMQB3gopoSQnDLIQNC/Admin-Dashboard--Community-?node-id=802-2337&t=1TtP7yjt9xbekpuJ-1`), stating the previous attempt was "getting much better" and requested specific KPI values (Total Acidentes, Total Mortos, Taxa de Mortalidade, Índice de Gravidade) to be aligned horizontally with spacing as shown in the new image. The user also requested changes to the font and icons for a better visual, granting the assistant full autonomy to use external libraries.

The assistant understood the new direction, identifying the new Figma model as an "Admin Dashboard" style with sparklines, vibrant colors (cyan/purple), and clean typography. It committed to rebuilding the dashboard using Lucide Icons, Google Fonts (Inter), real Plotly sparklines, and CSS Grid for alignment. The assistant then provided a complete, autonomous Streamlit code snippet, incorporating the requested visual elements: a BR-BYTES-style sidebar, a welcome banner, a horizontal KPI section with sparklines and specific values/trends, and placeholders for main charts, all styled with the new color palette and Inter font. The assistant also included a `create_sparkline` function to generate the mini-charts.

The user asked if the provided code was complete. The assistant confirmed it was the complete `app.py` file, but noted that the sparklines were using simulated data. It then provided an updated version of the `app.py` code, integrating the real data loading function and calculating KPIs from the `acidentes_mg_dashboard_master.csv` file.

The user uploaded an image (`imagem_2026-02-20_150949795.png`) and requested several visual adjustments:
1.  The text and sparklines within the KPI cards should be *inside* the boxes, not below them.
2.  Remove the "Juana Moreno" text and the associated blue circle from the header.
3.  Replace "BR-BYTES" in the sidebar with "PRF".

The assistant acknowledged these requests and provided a corrected `app.py` code. It explained that the issue with content being outside the boxes was
